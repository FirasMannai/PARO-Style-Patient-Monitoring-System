PARO BLE Monitoring & Recording System
An advanced Python-based recording station that bridges an ESP32-C6 (via BLE) with a Raspberry Pi. It captures real-time audio, calculates decibel levels, tracks physical posture using AI, and provides instant visual feedback via an RGB LED system.✨ Features🎧 Real-time Audio Processing: Streams 16kHz audio via BLE, calculates RMS decibels, and saves both raw and processed data.🧍 AI Pose Tracking: Integrated MediaPipe support to track 33 body landmarks via a PiCamera, logging data to JSONL for later analysis.🚨 Intelligent LED Status: A dedicated RGB LED system provides immediate feedback on connection, recording, and battery health.🔋 Power Monitoring: Monitors ESP32 voltage levels; automatically triggers a "Battery Low" visual override if voltage drops below 2.0V.💾 Automatic Session Management: Creates timestamped folders and generates manifest.json files for every recording session.🔄 Smart Reconnect: Features an Auto-Resume mode to maintain session continuity if the BLE connection drops.🚦 LED Status GuideThe system uses a 3-pin RGB LED to communicate the current state:ColorPatternMeaning🔵 BlueSolidIdle: Waiting for the first button press.🟡 YellowBlinkingSearching: Scanning for the ESP32C6-PARO device.🟢 GreenSolidConnected: Device found, waiting for user confirmation.🔴 RedSolidRecording: Audio data is actively being saved.🟣 VioletSolidBattery Low: ESP32 voltage is critically low (< 2.0V).⚪ WhiteSolidError: Device not found during scan.🛠️ Hardware SetupController: Raspberry Pi (with Bluetooth support).Microcontroller: ESP32-C6 (Broadcasting as ESP32C6-PARO).Peripherals:Button: Connected to BCM 12 (GND toggle).RGB LED: Pins BCM 23 (R), 24 (G), 25 (B).Camera: Official PiCamera (optional, for Pose Tracking).🚀 Getting Started1. Install DependenciesEnsure you have the necessary system libraries for lgpio and opencv:Bashsudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-lgpio
pip install bleak numpy scipy opencv-python mediapipe picamera2
2. ConfigurationOpen code.py to toggle optional features:CAMERA_ENABLED = True (Enable/Disable MediaPipe)SHOW_PREVIEW = False (Set to True to see the camera window)3. ExecutionRun the script with Python 3:Bashpython3 code.py
🕹️ User ControlsThe system operates on a Single-Button Toggle logic (BCM12 to GND):Press 1: Start searching for the ESP32.Press 2: Confirm connection and start recording/files.Press 3: Stop recording, close files, and convert Raw audio to .wav.📁 Data Output StructureAll data is saved to /Downloads/Muslim Messungen/ in a timestamped folder:Gesamt_raw_daten.raw/wav: Continuous audio stream.Paro_raw_daten.raw/wav: Audio filtered for significant sound levels.Strom_Spannung_Leistung.csv: Power telemetry (mA, V, mW).pose_TIMESTAMP.jsonl: Landmark coordinates from MediaPipe.manifest.json: Session metadata (start/end times, versions, stats).
